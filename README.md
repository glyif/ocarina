# ocarina
## Author: Bobby Yang (Batch 2)

## Synopsis
Ocarina is simple implementation of a doubly linked list built on top of a simple shell. Ocarina takes in commands and stores each command into a doubly linked list. So you can go back and access previous commands. I chose a doubly linked list instead of a singly linked list because then ocarina is able to retrieve commands relatively. For example I can retrieve a command that's `4` previous, then I can find commands relative to that command such as the command previous to that command.

Ocarina is made to only for implementing a doubly linked list. It's not able to run any actual commands besides the command to retrieve previous commands.
